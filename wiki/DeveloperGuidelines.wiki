#summary Coding guidelines for code contributions.

= Introduction =

This page is to list some of the more important guidelines for developers contributing code to osmdroid.  This is not intended to strictly enforce a particular style - more to keep the code internally consistent.


== General guidelines ==

 * Use tabs for intending, not spaces
 * Make variables final where possible
 * Prefix member variables with m
 * Prefix method arguments with a
 * Use org.slf4j.Logger, not android.util.Log

== Guidelines for osmdroid-android project ==

osmdroid-android references android.jar but the unit tests don't run on an Android device.  This means that the unit tests cannot invoke any Android methods.  In order to avoid this, proxies are used in the most common cases:

 * Use org.andnav.osm.!ResourceProxy, not Context.getResource

Those are the main less obvious guidelines.  In general, try and follow the existing style.
